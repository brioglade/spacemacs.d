This project began in earnest during Winter Break 2017. We called that version
1.0, and keeping track of the version history seemed like a good idea at the
time.

** v 1.0 :: 2017.12

   - Created the initial directory structure
   - Ported the extra functions and misc into =ha-goodies= collection
   - Ported the org configuration into =ha-org=
   - Created a way for /computer-specific/ configuration can be stored
