Didn't take me long after using Spacemacs to start adding my customization.
While many initial changes could have been avoided by simply searching for the
Spacemacs default.

Anyway, here we are. An initial attempt as slowly doing some sort of a migration
(based mostly on immediate need).

The documentation for Spacemacs is generally quite good, but the following are
random notes and tips that I often forget and can't find easily.

* Prefix Keys

  Spacemacs has the =which-key= system changes the word ~prefix~ to a better
  indicator of the subkeys, so to create a labeled entry in the key help area:

  #+BEGIN_SRC elisp
    (spacemacs/declare-prefix "a f" "far out")
    (spacemacs/set-leader-keys "a f c" 'far-out-crazy-func)
  #+END_SRC
