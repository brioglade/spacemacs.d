* Description

  Extracting all my /beautification/ of Spacemacs into its own layer.

  Not exactly sure what I'll be doing here, but I would certainly like to make
  the modeline a bit less clutter, but also more useful to me.

* Install

  To use this configuration layer, add it to your =~/.spacemacs=. You will need
  to add =ha-ui= to the existing =dotspacemacs-configuration-layers= list in
  this file.

* Key bindings

  No key bindings are expected in this layer.
