* Description

  Most of my miscellaneous improvements to Emacs (primarily functions) reside
  here. Not much rhyme or reason except that I had no where else to place them.

* Install

  To use this configuration layer, add it to your =~/.spacemacs=. You will need
  to add =ha-ui= to the existing =dotspacemacs-configuration-layers= list in
  this file.

* Key bindings

  - C-<Return> :: opens up a new line even if the point is in the middle of a
                  line (similar to the =o= in the normal evil state).

  - <SPC> f + :: find file that is numerically larger than current file.
  - <SPC> f - :: find file that is numerically less than current file.
  - <SPC> f n :: searches my notes directory for phrases (need my =find-notes= script)
